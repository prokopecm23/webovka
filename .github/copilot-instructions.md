## Project Overview
A single-player, turn-based roguelike game using Node.js and Express, playable in a web browser. The server launches automatically, prints a local URL, and serves a frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) that acts as a renderer and input layer. Game logic (turn-based, grid, enemies, stealth, items, pathfinding, etc.) runs server-side. No visible detection indicators. Modular, clean architecture. Keyboard controls, message log, and clear enemy facing direction. No multiplayer.
